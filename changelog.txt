2.00 MAJOR UPDATE - Updated by Joey Tran
General
Added GUI to streamline analysis process
kinem_cat
- Added functionality to interpolate for 1-2 bad bins and separate bad rounds  
- Added functionality to compare two different tasks and look and statistical significance 
kinem_cat_coords
- Added functionality to compare two different tasks and look for statistical significance  
- Looking at different tasks outputs to two different output text files  

2.01
- Changed fillgaps into two different functions, one for the general data and one for the specific 
file data. General data has a median filter with that takes out anything that spikes
more than 1% of median since general the x changes very small per second.
- Changed GUI to save edit8 and edit9, otherwise task 1 and task 2 for the 
bin_gui

2.02
- Fixed a bug that would run bin analysis always with Px and ignore parameter choice of GUI
- Added total stride length for coordinaet analysis
- Added a fillgaps filter under a new component function file called 'fillgaps_alldata'. Allows specific range filter
- Added lines of code to reset path on every run

2.03
- Added multiple analysis functionality

2.04
- Commented more for the code
- Added an additional component to binfilter that allows for close to zero bins without filtering everything as a bad round.
- Added code to bypass rounds with no steps for whatever reason
- Coord GUI now saves previous inputs

2.05
- Fixed big bug that limited how many steps were output from coord program
- Added functionality to adjust z values based on floor LEDs


NEED TO DO'S
- Edit fillgap functionaliy to work regardless of sign
